							<h3><strong>Description:</strong></h3>
							<p>We created a fun little mobile game based on the pokemon GO formula. This game tracks your GPS location and moves your in game character <br>
							as you move around in real life. If you switch modes at a location, the game will change into an Augmented Reality mode. In this mode, you can <br>
							plant trees that generate income and fight off the pandas the stunt your tree's growth and income production. For our bonus task, we created a <br>
							custom avatar and a tree merging mechanic. Trees can be merged when there are at least 20 trees within a radius of the player. The merged tree <br>
							has golden leaves, and grows to be much larger than the other trees. The income it produces is also based on the value of the trees used to make <br>
							it, and it is generally a pretty large bonus.
							
							<h3><strong>Technology Usage:</strong></h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Unity</strong> - Our main development tool, used with C# to build the application. The app is inspired by Pok√©mon Go, where players plant trees that grow to generate gold. Occasionally, a panda enemy spawns to attack the tree, halting gold generation and growth. Players can throw bamboo to fend off the panda's attack.</li>
								<li><strong>XCode</strong> - IDE used to deploy the Unity-built application to an iPhone as a mobile app.</li>
								<li><strong>JIRA</strong> - Task management tool to track progress, mark tasks as finished or unfinished, and assign responsibilities among team members.</li>
								<li><strong>OBS Studio</strong> - Recording software used to capture project previews, which are shared on YouTube and Discord.</li>
								<li><strong>GitLab</strong> - Version control system for collaborative work, enabling file sharing and team access.</li>
								<li><strong>Discord</strong> - Primary communication tool for team discussions and updates.</li>
								<li><strong>YouTube</strong> - Primary platform for sharing recorded project footage.</li>
								<li><strong>Google Drive</strong> - Alternative platform for sharing recorded project footage.</li>
								<li><strong>iPhone 14 Pro</strong> - Device used to test the application on a mobile platform.</li>
