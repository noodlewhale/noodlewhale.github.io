							<p>Description</p>
							<p>In this project, a semi accurate representation of the Cain Lab the Beister Building has been modeled and can be walked through with VR.<br> 
							The representation includes interactabe lightswithes and firealarms that changes the lighting and ambient noise. It also contains trash that can <br>
							be either tossed in the bin or duplicated on the multiple copy machines in the lab. If you want to draw, there is a rudimentary whiteboard. <br>
							There are also various npcs that you can talk to though they arent too glad to interact with you. If you talk to an npc while the fire alarm <br>
							is on, it will trigger a minigame where you have to find 5 buttons within 45 seconds. If you fail, you can always try again, but if you succeed, <br>
							you get rewarded with two physics based rocket launchers that can bring mahem to lab.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Technology Usage</p>
							<li><strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> - This tool was used to model the cainlab and create all the interactables.</li>
							<li><strong>Unreal Engine Blueprints</strong> - This was our primary tool for programming different functions within the lab.</li>
							<li><strong>JIRA</strong> - Jira was used to assign tasks, stay on schedule, and break down larger issues into digestable tasks. </li>
							<li><strong>OBS Studio</strong> - OBS was used to recorded a preview of our VR environment.</li>
							<li><strong>GitLab</strong> - This is our version control system to share work between different people and store our files.</li>
							<li><strong>Discord</strong> - Main communication tool between group members.</li>
							<li><strong>YouTube</strong> - Main way to share recorded footage of work.</li>
